I’m a software engineer and long-time skateboarder. Before software, I had a past life in Fine Art.

Since leaving my role as an engineering manager last year, I’ve become a core contributor for a generative art group, worked on a few different product ideas, and have most recently built governance tooling for a decentralized financial exchange.
